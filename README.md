🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Decision Tree

This project uses the classic Iris dataset to demonstrate how simple machine learning techniques like Decision Tree Classification can effectively identify flower species based on petal and sepal dimensions. It’s built in Python using scikit-learn and matplotlib.

🔍 Problem Statement

We aim to classify iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — using just two features:
	•	Petal Length (cm)
	•	Petal Width (cm)

The goal is to train a simple but effective model, visualize its decision boundaries, and evaluate its accuracy.


📊 Dataset

We used the well-known Iris dataset provided by sklearn.datasets. It contains 150 samples and 4 features for each flower:
	•	Sepal length
	•	Sepal width
	•	Petal length
	•	Petal width

🧠 What this project covers
	•	Data exploration (visualizations & distributions)
	•	Feature selection
	•	Train-test split
	•	Fitting a DecisionTreeClassifier
	•	Plotting decision boundaries
	•	Evaluating model accuracy

✅ Results
	•	Training Accuracy: 95.83%
	•	Test Accuracy: 100%
